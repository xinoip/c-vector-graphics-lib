# Vector Library for SVG and EPS files

Library for creating vector graphics in C.

# Warning

This library is highly unefficient. This was made for C programming course term project.

Library only uses paths for producing the eps or svg file. Because of that the produced file will be much bigger in size.

## Compiling and Running

Just Make the makefile and run the demo.

You can produce both SVG and EPS files.
